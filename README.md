## Notes

The video walkthroughs were very helpful, but I had to use an alternative method to connect Android Studio with GitHub. 
My credentials would not work properly on the Androis Studio VCS menu for GitHub so I had to make and use a security token.
The first time I used a token the project still failed to upload properly and I had to figure out where to change the credentials 
again because the way shown in the video is only for initial setup.
